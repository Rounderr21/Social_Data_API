# Project Description:
This Project is designed to create a database for a social media API. With this database we can create Users, Find Users by specific ID, Update a User, Delete a User, Add friends to the User, and delete friends from the User. We can also create Thoughts, Find Thought by specific ID, remove a Thought, create a Reaction to a Thought, and Delete a Reaction to a Thought.

To start the project, open the terminal. Type `node index.js` into the terminal. The Server will then be live. Using Insomnia we can create different Get, Post, Delete, and Put routes to add or delete things from the database.

# Javascript Files:
Started with no starter code for index.js. started by installing all npm's that i needed such as `express`, `mongodb`, `mongoose`, and `nodemon`. Created models to make a database. Created controllers to recieve all Get, Post, Delete, and Put infromation. created routes to make the user be able to use the Get, Post, Delete, and Put routes to feed information into the database

# Github:
Pushed out Javascript, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.
